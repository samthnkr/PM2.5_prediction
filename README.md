# PM2.5_prediction_using_ANN
1. Conducted an in-depth analysis of spatial(location.csv) and temporal(sensor.csv) data for PM2.5 prediction using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The analysis involved identifying and extracting essential features for both analysis and prediction purposes.
2. Performed data manipulation techniques such as dataframe melting, pandas encoding, and standard scaling on a dataset consisting of 46 features and 7260 values. These techniques ensured that the data was properly formatted and prepared for subsequent analysis and modeling.
3. Evaluated the performance of the ANN model using various metrics. The evaluation results indicated a loss of approximately 17%, an r2 score of 62%, and a correlation score of 87%. These scores provide insights into the model's predictive accuracy and demonstrate its ability to capture patterns and relationships within the PM2.5 data.
